# **IT17113946 N.D Perera**

LAB Structure

1 Windows Machine

FTP Server Planted(Exploiting this ftp server)

1 Kali Machine

A Simple Server is coded in order to send and receive instructions and deliver payloads

We will be using immunity Debugger(In order to debug and find EIP ESP)

Like I described in the video I have divided my attack into four steps. Step by step I have shown how I developed the program to attack.

1st I installed an ftp server in the windows machine (we will then exploit this ftp server in order gain access to the windows machine) then in the kali linux side I have created a simple server in order to send and receive Data. (this is the server that we are using to send the payload and attack the windows)

In the left hand side is the basic code that I started developing in there 1st im sending 1000 As to check the Attack is happening

Here you can see the 1000 A.

Here You can see the Error message. Because of the 1st part of the exploit.

In the second step instead of the 1000A we are using a character set we developed this character set from the ./patern\_create.rb -l 1000 ()(we are creating 1000 random characters)

The Code

After the exploit memory slots are filled with different different characters .

The main thing we understood from here is the EIP address. ![](RackMultipart20200513-4-14g5mzo_html_79f7cd8c4ea96438.png)

After finding the eip address we are using a module called ./patern\_offset.rb -q \*YOU Must Enter The EIP Address found in immunity debugger this space\* -l 1000

We need 247 characters to get 247 bytes to get to the eip and theres 4 bytes for eip rest is 1000-247

IN the 3rd part of the development

payload = &quot;A&quot;\*247 + B\*4&quot; + shellcode + &quot;C&quot;\*(749-len(shellcode))

we are using B\*4 to find the memory address

now our next step is to tell EIP to jump to the next register

Now we found the memory address and then we are binding it to our payload

payload = &quot;A&quot;\*247 + &quot;\x53\x93\x42\x7E&quot; + shellcode + &quot;C&quot;\*(749-len(shellcode))

&quot;\x53\x93\x42\x7E -------ïƒ  memory address in little Indian format

Finally we are inside windows.
